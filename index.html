			<p>I'm a community builder, expert growth hacker, B2B marketer, one of the best product minds you'll come across, pretty good at getting all kinds of stuff done and communicating with people. I built this website as part of full-stack dev course I'm taking for fun.</p><br>
			
			<p> I was one of the 3 person founding team of <a href="https://www.google.com/partners/" style = "text-decoration:none; color:#4aaaa5;" target="_blank">Google Partners</a> - a community of local businesses helping each other advertise online. Our experiment became an umbrella program for all of Google's agency business, employing hundreds and generating billions in revenue. </p><br>

			<p>A couple of side projects I'm especially proud of at Google include being the global lead for teams across 18 markets, running the first international <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wMH7QEikS1g?autoplay=1" style = "text-decoration:none; color:#4aaaa5;" target="_blank">Doodle for Google</a> competition where kids everywhere submitted their drawings for the chance to appear on the Google homepage. I also lead the Israeli effort of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnKJpYGCLsg" style = "text-decoration:none; color:#4aaaa5;" target="_blank">Youtube Symphony Orchestra</a> bringing musicians from all over the world to perform together in Carnegy Hall.</p><br>


			<p> I then joined a couple of pre-seed startups as their first employee. One of them is <a href="http://www.honeybook.com" style = "text-decoration:none; color:#4aaaa5;" target="_blank">Honeybook</a> - today a series B company with hundereds of employees. </p><br>

			<p> I'm curretnly building <a href="http://www.rooster.co" style = "text-decoration:none; color:#4aaaa5;" target="_blank">Rooster</a> - the pay it forward movement. It is a local social network where neighbors help each other for free. We are the fastest growing local social network, reaching 20% of the households in our first city (Portland, OR) with a notable brand that's been covered on all major local media channels and great user engagement. We've raised $1.5M and are members of <a href="http://www.nfx.co" style = "text-decoration:none; color:#4aaaa5;" target="_blank">NFX Guild</a>. We're currently figuring out how to scale Rooster to more cities and how we can generate income to support growing it.</p><br>

			<p> When I'm not immersed in my projects I enjoy traveling, nomading, hiking and playing guitar. I've traveled through most countries in Europe, South and Central america, a good chunk of the states in the US and also Australia, Canada, Thailand and New Zealand. Oh Kenya too. Still gotta visit east Asia and some places in Africa - Madagascar in particular. </p><br>
